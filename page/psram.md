# External Memory

The [P2-EC32MB](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-edge-module-with-32mb-ram/) (as seen held by the shrine maiden on the page header) is equipped with four QPI-interface pseudo-static RAM (PSRAM) chips, together holding 32 MiB of data that can be accessed through a 16 bit bus.

Other common memory configurations include:

 - [Rayslogic 24MB Add-on](https://www.rayslogic.com/DonateForGear/24MB_P2Eval_Access.htm): 3 PSRAM chips, 4 bit bus.
 - [Rayslogic 96MB Add-on](https://www.rayslogic.com/DonateForGear/96MB_P2Eval_Access.htm): 12 PSRAM chips, 8 bit bus.
 - [Parallax 64004-ES HyperRAM/HyperFlash Add-on](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-es-eval-board-hyperram-hyperflash-add-on/): TODO HyperRAM is different. 8 bit bus.


**TODO.** In the meantime, check [the PSRAM chip datasheet](common/APM_PSRAM_QSPI_APS6404L_3SQR_v2_3_PKG-1954826.pdf).
